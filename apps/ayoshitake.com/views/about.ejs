          <p>Red Pill Web Masons is a fellowship of men and women who share their experience, strength, and hope with each other that they may solve their common problem and help others to recover from technophobia.</p>
          <p>The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop being computer illiterate.</p>
          <p>There are no dues or fees for WBA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.</p>
          <p>RPWM is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution; does not wish to engage in any controversy, neither endorses nor opposes any causes.</p>
          <p>Our primary purpose is to stay sober (or not) and help other technophobes to achieve technical proficiency in their chosen area(s) of expertise.</p>
