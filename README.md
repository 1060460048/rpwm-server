===========

This repo contains the Red Pill Web Masons' Node.js web server (and the files it serves).

This repo is complete except for a single file - modules/db.config - which holds database credentials. This file can be obtained from me by <a href="mailto:airandfingers@gmail.com">asking nicely</a>.
